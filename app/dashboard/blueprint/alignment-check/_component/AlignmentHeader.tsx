              The Alignment Check is a collaborative process that ensures teams
              are aware of the current landscape and internal and external
              factors that could impact the companyâ€™s current and future
              direction. It fosters the shared development of strategic
              directions and ensures that teams and decision-makers are on the
              same page. Importantly, stakeholders review and either approve or
              offer suggestions, nurturing a sense of shared responsibility and
              active participation.

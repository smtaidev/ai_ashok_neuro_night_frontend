          Essentially, values serve as a communication tool, conveying the organization's priorities and offering clear guidance for decision-making.

          Target customers are the specific people or groups a business seeks to serve. Instead of trying to please everyone, successful companies identify these specific individuals or groups and tailor their products or services to meet their unique needs and preferences. This approach helps businesses focus their efforts and resources on the right audience, leading to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty.
